As housing prices soared to unsustainable levels, the bubble eventually burst, triggering a chain of events that contributed to the financial meltdown.

Financial institutions, such as investment banks, mortgage lenders, and insurance companies, engaged in irresponsible lending, securitization, and risky derivative trading practices that amplified the crisis. Homeowners and borrowers also played a part, as many took on mortgages they could not afford, fueled by the belief that housing prices would continue to rise indefinitely.

Investment banks and rating agencies played a crucial role by packaging these risky mortgages into complex financial products and giving them top credit ratings, misleading investors about the actual risks involved. Regulatory agencies also failed in their oversight responsibilities, allowing these risky practices to flourish unchecked.
