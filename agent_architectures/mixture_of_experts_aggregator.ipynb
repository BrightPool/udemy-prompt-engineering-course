      "\n",
      "1. **Explore Golden Gate Park**: This expansive urban park offers something for everyone. Key attractions include the California Academy of Sciences, which houses an aquarium, planetarium, and natural history museum. You can also visit the de Young Museum for art exhibits, the Japanese Tea Garden for a serene experience, and the San Francisco Botanical Garden to enjoy a diverse range of plant species. Renting a bike is a great way to cover more ground and take in the park's lush scenery.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Visit Fisherman's Wharf and Pier 39**: This bustling waterfront area is a must-see for tourists. Enjoy fresh seafood at one of the many restaurants, watch sea lions lounging on the docks, and explore various shops and street performances. From here, you can also take a ferry to Alcatraz Island, where you can tour the infamous former prison and learn about its history.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Ride a Cable Car**: Experience a piece of San Francisco's history by riding one of its iconic cable cars. The Powell-Hyde and Powell-Mason lines offer scenic routes through some of the city's most famous neighborhoods, including Nob Hill and Fisherman's Wharf. It's a fun and unique way to see the city's hilly landscape and vibrant streets.\n",
