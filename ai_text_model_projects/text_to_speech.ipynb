This bill, which aims to restrict landlords' ability to evict tenants without a valid reason, has faced delays and amendments due to concerns raised by Conservative MPs about potential burdens on landlords.\n",

She also lambasted the government's efforts to ban leaseholds, arguing it would not benefit the majority of leaseholders.\n",

Will the government uphold its pledge to protect tenants from no-fault evictions, or will further delays leave vulnerable families at risk? Stay tuned as the battle for housing rights unfolds in Westminster.\n"
