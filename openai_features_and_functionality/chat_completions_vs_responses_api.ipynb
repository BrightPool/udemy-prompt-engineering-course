    "# Comparing Chat Completions & Responses APIs\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook explains the differences between two approaches for interacting with the OpenAI chat API:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Chat Completions API (`chat.completions.create()`)**: A more *raw* interface where you provide a list of messages. In this model, you must handle the conversation state manually if you want to carry context from one turn to the next.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Responses API (`responses.create()`)**: A newer, stateful API that not only lets you send messages but also automatically manages conversation state, making it easier to chain requests. This API is designed to be used with agents and will eventually replace the Assistants API.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below, we'll break down the differences in arguments and design, and then look at a minimal code example for each."

   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "## Key Differences\n",
    "\n",
    "- **State Management**:\n",
    "  - **Chat Completions**: You provide a `messages` array; every call is stateless unless you manually add previous messages.\n",
    "  - **Responses API**: Automatically manages conversation state. You can chain requests easily using parameters like `store` and `previous_response_id`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Arguments & Structure**:\n",
    "  - **Chat Completions**: Mainly accepts a `messages` array with objects having keys like `role` and `content`. It returns results in a `choices` list, where you get the output from `message.content`.\n",
    "  - **Responses API**: Uses an `input` parameter (or an array of message objects) and returns a structured `output` which aggregates results. It also provides additional state management features.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Future Direction**:\n",
    "  - The Responses API is designed for building agents and will replace the current Assistants API. It offers a smoother developer experience by holding the chat context between turns.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, while the Chat Completions endpoint gives you direct control but requires manual state management, the Responses API simplifies multi-turn interactions and is better suited for advanced applications."
