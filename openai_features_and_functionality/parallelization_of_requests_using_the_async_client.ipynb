    "## What is Async and Why Use It?\n",
    "\n",
    "Asynchronous programming allows multiple operations to run concurrently without blocking each other. When making API calls:\n",
    "- Synchronous: Each request must complete before the next one starts\n",
    "- Asynchronous: Multiple requests can be \"in flight\" simultaneously\n",
    "\n",
    "This is especially useful when:\n",
    "- Making many API calls in parallel\n",
    "- Handling long-running operations without blocking\n",
    "- Building responsive applications\n",
    "\n",
    "## How We'll Demonstrate It\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll compare:\n",
    "1. Making multiple synchronous API calls sequentially \n",
    "2. Making the same calls asynchronously in parallel\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll see how async can dramatically reduce total execution time when making multiple requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "- `async/await`: Python keywords for writing asynchronous code\n",
    "- `AsyncOpenAI`: The async version of the OpenAI client\n",
    "- `asyncio.gather()`: For running multiple async operations in parallel\n",

Kamala isn't perfect and sometimes she comes off as too rehearsed, but at least I feel like she understands how broken things are for patients and nurses. Besides, I'm tired of the constant drama.

You don't have to consider every possible option, that would be tedious. Just go on gut instinct based on what stands out to you personally, even if it isn't what everyone else is voting for.
