    "# Streaming API Responses\n",

    "By default, the API generates the entire output before returning it. Using streaming, you can begin processing the response as the model generates output, which is useful for long completions or when you want to display partial results immediately.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our example, we'll ask the model to recite the tongue twister \"Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers\" five times. We then loop through the streamed events and print each event, allowing you to see how the response is built incrementally.\n",
